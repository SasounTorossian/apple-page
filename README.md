# apple-page
apple home page from 2014 replica based off the Odin project curriculum. Live demo can be found on github.io [here](https://sasountorossian.github.io/apple-page/).

Main goal of project was to not use any modern display element like flexbox or grid, instead relying on inline, inline-block, block, and various positional attributes. Project was not particularily challenging.
